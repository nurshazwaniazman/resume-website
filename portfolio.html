Meanwhile, the archive proposal required me to plan the archive building, and create the building in 2D and 3D during the Degree. Below is the link that linked to these projects. </p>

From these projects, I have learned from the basic coding to the specific, which is quite challenging for me as a beginner but this project has got a lot of praise from lectures. There are two website projects that have been done with different categories which are personal websites and business websites. Below is the link to my website that I have created previously.</p>

                                                Have created an interactive learning website for an assignment project and got rewarded by my lecturer, which is Puan Razifah Othman. This portfolio brings me and my team members to the first place on creative ideas on web creation and development for one of Information Management‚Äôs courses known as Technical Support Service and Maintenance for Information Agencies (IM222).

                                                This project required me to create a website that will be used for teaching and learning purposes. The contents of the website must be related to the syllabus learned, and we are also required to make the website are user friendly, interactive, and attractive to learn among the viewers and readers.
                                                <br><br>
                                                This project has won the competitions due to a few reasons stated by my lecturer. One of the reasons is due to our learning games that are created by using PowerPoint with a theme that may attract the viewers to learn the subjects by having these games. Below are the link of the project in the form of video that has been created by me and my team members during Diploma and the games inside PowerPoint.
